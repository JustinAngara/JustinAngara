I've been coding since I was 13 (2019) with Java and self-studied for 2 years (though my first program ever made was back in 2015 p.s. check out my first minecraft mod somewhere in my repos!). I took AP Computer Science my Sophomore year and got a 5 on the AP Exam. 
This was the first time I have recieved formal instruction. 

### Present (University of Wisconsin-Madison)
Now I work at a different startup, AI & Prototyping Engineer, contracting for a telecom industry client, am still working on coding projects, and currently exploring different avenues.
